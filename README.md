## Description
Nutrigram is a full-stack web application that aims to help users direct them to maintaining a healthy diet by allowing them to upload and manage their favourite recipes. 
It will encourage users to track their calorie intake and discover recipes shared by other users. As well as allow users to share their recipes privately to their friends.

## Frontend Framework
- ReactJs + react router

## Additional Requirements
- Uploads posted by friends will be displayed in a separate tab on a global explorer page, where friends' newest recipes will reflect the user's feed.
- If time allows, a backend AI model will be implemented to score the user's uploaded recipes according to a health metric.

## Version Milestones
- Apha: aim to complete the design and implementation of the main frontend portion of the application
- Beta: integrate the backend and implement the basic features related to users - signup, payment, signout and upload content
- Final: aim to complete the features detailed in the "Additional Requirements" section and have it deployed
