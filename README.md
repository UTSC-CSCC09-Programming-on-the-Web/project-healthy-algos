## Description
Web-based simulation application in which AI powered agents will roam a 2-dimensional plane and interact with the environment. 
Players will be able to interact and converse with the AI agents, influencing the AI to take different actions.

## Frontend Framework
- ReactJs + react router

## Additional Requirements
- AI movement and player movement will be updated live without the need to refresh
- A parallel task queue will calculate AI decisions and actions
- If time allows, we will implement proximity-based voice chat to converse with the AI

## Version Milestones
- Alpha: aim to complete user login and stripe, as well as a basic plane and agent sprites (and potentially player movement)
- Beta: implement basic task queue and AI powered agents
- Final: increase AI action choices and increase dynamic player interaction + deployment
